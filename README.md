# 🦾 Advanced Python Architecture for Automation & Embedded Systems

## 📝 Project Description
This repository serves as a comprehensive reference architecture and toolkit for advanced  programming, strictly tailored for automation engineering, robotics, and embedded systems. It moves beyond basic scripting to implement robust, enterprise-grade design patterns. The codebase focuses on hardware-safe state machines, dynamic plugin loading, rigorous memory management, and concurrent data processing to bridge the gap between high-level software and physical hardware control.

## ⚙️ System
The modules in this repository are designed to act as independent but highly cohesive architectural building blocks. 
* **Execution Flow:** Hardware processes are managed via a robust Finite State Machine (`state_machine.py`), ensuring safe transitions and emergency stops.
* **Concurrency:** CPU-bound mathematical calculations (like inverse kinematics) are handled by bypassing the GIL (`multiprocessing.py`), while I/O-bound sensor readings utilize `async.py` and threaded locks.
* **Extensibility:** New sensor drivers or actuators can be dropped into the `dynamic_import/plugins/` folder and are loaded at runtime without modifying the core system.
* **Reliability:** All critical hardware operations are wrapped in advanced context managers and custom decorators to guarantee safe teardown and strict execution timing.

## 🗂️ Code Structure
The repository is modularized by architectural concepts:

## 📌 Notes

* **Python Version:** Requires Python 3.8+ (Python 3.10+ recommended for advanced Type Hinting capabilities like `Protocol`).
* **Dependencies:** Ensure `pyyaml`, `python-dotenv`, and `rich` are installed via `pip`.
* **Hardware Safety:** When using the `state_machine.py` or `multiprocessing.py` in physical applications, always ensure emergency physical kill-switches are independent of the software layer.


## ⚠️ Common Errors

* **`RecursionError` in Decorators:** Usually caused by forgetting to use `functools.wraps` or calling the wrapper recursively instead of the original function.
* **Deadlocks in Multithreading:** Ensure you are using `threading.RLock()` instead of `Lock()` if a thread needs to acquire the same lock multiple times in a nested method.
* **Corrupt Shared Memory (Multiprocessing):** When using `multiprocessing.Array`, always wrap write operations in a `multiprocessing.Lock()` to avoid race conditions between CPU cores.
* **StopIteration unhandled in Generators:** When manually using `next()` on a custom iterator, ensure you catch the `StopIteration` exception if not using a standard `for` loop.
